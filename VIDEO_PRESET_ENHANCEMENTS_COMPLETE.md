# Video Preset Enhancements - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive video preset enhancements across the playground video tab and preset detail pages to help users understand how presets work with video generation.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Video Mode Badges in Video Tab ✅

**File:** `apps/web/app/components/playground/VideoGenerationPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added a "Video Support" badge section that appears when a preset is selected
- Displays badges based on preset's recommended input mode:
  - **📝 Best for: Text-to-Video** (blue) - for text-to-image presets
  - **🎬 Best for: Image-to-Video** (purple) - for image-to-image presets
  - **✨ Works with Both** (green) - for flexible presets
- Shows provider compatibility indicator:
  - "⚠️ Better with Wan" for text-to-image presets on Seedream
  - "✅ Compatible with [Provider]" for compatible combinations

**Location:** Lines 659-714 in VideoGenerationPanel.tsx

### Phase 2: Provider-Aware Hints ✅

**File:** `apps/web/app/components/playground/VideoGenerationPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**
Added intelligent contextual hints that appear based on preset + provider + image selection:

1. **Seedream + text-to-image preset + no image**
   - 💡 "This preset works best with text prompts, but Seedream requires an image. Switch to Wan provider for text-to-video or upload an image below."

2. **Wan + image-to-image preset + no image**
   - 💡 "This preset is optimized for image-to-video. Upload or select an image from the 'Image Source' section below for best results."

3. **Any provider + text-to-image preset + has image**
   - 💡 "This preset works best with text prompts only. Consider removing the image or switching to a different preset for image-to-video."

4. **Seedream + flexible preset + no image**
   - 💡 "This flexible preset works with both modes, but Seedream requires an image. Upload an image below or switch to Wan provider for text-to-video."

**Location:** Lines 766-840 in VideoGenerationPanel.tsx

**Design:**
- Blue theme for text-to-video hints
- Purple theme for image-to-video hints
- Green theme for flexible mode hints
- Sparkles icon for all hints to indicate recommendations

### Phase 3: Enhanced Preset Detail Pages ✅

**File:** `apps/web/app/presets/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

1. **Added Video icon import** (line 23)
2. **Updated Preset interface** to include `generation_mode` field (line 45)
3. **Added Video Generation Support card** in Overview tab (lines 637-717)

**Video Support Card Features:**
- Green-themed card with Video icon
- Main badge: "🎬 Supports Video Generation"
- Mode-specific badges showing compatible video modes:
  - Flexible: Shows both Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video badges
  - Text-to-image: Shows "Best for Text-to-Video"
  - Image-to-image: Shows "Best for Image-to-Video"
- **Provider Compatibility section** with detailed info:
  - Lists which providers work best with this preset
  - Explains mode compatibility for Seedream and Wan
- **"Use in Video Generator" button** that navigates to `/playground?tab=video&preset={id}`

**Visibility:**
- Only appears for presets with `generation_mode = 'both'` or `'video'`
- All 69 existing presets will show this section (they're all set to 'both')

## Files Modified

1. **`apps/web/app/components/playground/VideoGenerationPanel.tsx`**
   - Added video mode badge section (lines 659-714)
   - Added provider-aware hints (lines 766-840)

2. **`apps/web/app/presets/[id]/page.tsx`**
   - Added Video icon import (line 23)
   - Updated Preset interface (line 45)
   - Added Video Generation Support card (lines 637-717)

## Expected User Experience

### In Playground Video Tab:
1. User selects a preset → Sees "Video Support" badge showing recommended mode
2. User sees provider compatibility indicator
3. If configuration isn't optimal → Sees smart contextual hint with specific recommendations

### In Preset Detail Page:
1. User views any preset with video support → Sees green "Video Generation Support" card
2. Card shows:
   - Which video modes are supported (text-to-video, image-to-video, or both)
   - Which providers work best with this preset
   - Direct button to use preset in video generator

## Technical Notes

### No Database Changes Required
All functionality uses existing data:
- `generation_mode` column (image/video/both)
- `technical_settings->generation_mode` (text-to-image/image-to-image/flexible)

### Smart Detection
- System automatically detects image-to-video vs text-to-video mode based on image presence
- Hints appear/disappear dynamically as user changes providers or uploads/removes images

### Consistent Design
- Uses same badge color scheme as image tab:
  - Blue for text-based modes
  - Purple for image-based modes
  - Green for flexible/both modes
- Follows existing UI patterns and styling

## Testing Checklist

## Impact

### Benefits:

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. Add video-specific prompt templates for select presets (`prompt_template_video` column)
2. Track video generation usage separately from image generation
3. Add video examples to preset galleries
4. Create video-only presets for specialized video effects

## Summary
