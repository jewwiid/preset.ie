# Collaboration Invitations System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the collaboration invitation system for the Preset platform, allowing project creators to invite users to private and invite-only projects.

---

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Layer (Migration: 099_collaboration_invitations.sql)

#### New Table: `collab_invitations`
- **id**: UUID primary key
- **project_id**: Reference to collab_projects
- **inviter_id**: User who sent the invitation
- **invitee_id**: User being invited (nullable for email invitations)
- **invitee_email**: Email address for non-platform users
- **role_id**: Optional specific role invitation
- **invitation_token**: Unique token for email-based invitations
- **status**: pending, accepted, declined, expired, cancelled
- **message**: Personal invitation message
- **expires_at**: Expiration date (default 30 days)
- **created_at**, **accepted_at**, **responded_at**: Timestamps

#### Updated RLS Policies
- ‚úÖ Updated `collab_projects_read` policy to include invited users
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive RLS policies for invitation CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Security: Only project creators can send invitations
- ‚úÖ Security: Only invitees can accept/decline invitations

#### Helper Functions
- `generate_invitation_token()`: Auto-generates unique tokens
- `update_invitation_responded_at()`: Tracks response timestamps
- `add_invited_user_as_participant()`: Automatically adds users when invitation accepted
- `expire_old_invitations()`: Cleanup function for expired invitations
- `user_has_project_access()`: Checks user access to projects
- `get_user_invitation_stats()`: Returns invitation statistics

#### Indexes
- Performance optimized with 7 indexes on key fields

---

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Project Invitations
**POST** `/api/collab/projects/[id]/invitations`
- Send invitation to user (by ID or email)
- Optional role assignment
- Personal message support
- Validation: prevents duplicate pending invitations

**GET** `/api/collab/projects/[id]/invitations`
- List all invitations for a project
- Only accessible to project creator
- Includes inviter, invitee, and role details

#### User Invitations
**GET** `/api/collab/invitations`
- Get current user's pending invitations
- Filterable by status
- Includes full project and inviter details

**PATCH** `/api/collab/invitations/[id]`
- Accept, decline, or cancel invitation
- Validates permissions and expiration
- Auto-adds user as participant on acceptance

**DELETE** `/api/collab/invitations/[id]`
- Revoke/delete invitation
- Only accessible to inviter or project creator

#### Enhanced Projects API
**GET** `/api/collab/projects?view=[all|my_projects|invited]`
- `all`: Public projects (existing behavior)
- `my_projects`: Projects created by current user
- `invited`: Projects user has been invited to
- Maintains all existing filters and pagination

  roles?: Array<{ id: string; role_name: string }>;
  onInviteSent?: () => void;
}
```

#### InvitationsList Component
**Location**: `apps/web/components/collaborate/InvitationsList.tsx`

**Features**:
- Displays pending invitations
- Accept/Decline buttons
- Shows project details, inviter info
- Personal message display

---

### 4. Updated Collaborate Page

**Location**: `apps/web/app/collaborate/page.tsx`

#### New Tab System

## üîÑ User Flow

### Scenario 1: Creating an Invite-Only Project
1. User creates project with `visibility: 'invite_only'`
2. Project appears in "My Projects" tab
3. User clicks "Invite People" button
4. Searches for user or enters email
5. Optionally selects role and adds message
6. Sends invitation
7. Invitee receives notification (when notifications integrated)

### Scenario 2: Receiving and Accepting Invitation
1. User receives invitation notification
2. Visits "Invitations" tab
3. Reviews project details and personal message
4. Clicks "Accept" or "Decline"
5. If accepted:
   - Added as project participant
   - Project appears in accessible projects
   - Invitation marked as accepted
6. If declined:
   - Invitation marked as declined
   - Removed from invitations list

### Scenario 3: Managing Project Invitations
1. Project creator views "My Projects"
2. Opens project details
3. Sees list of sent invitations with statuses
4. Can revoke pending invitations
5. Tracks accepted/declined responses

## üìã Database Migration Instructions

### To Apply Migration
```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or run migration file directly
psql -d your_database -f supabase/migrations/099_collaboration_invitations.sql
```

### Migration Safety
- ‚úÖ Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses
- ‚úÖ Drops and recreates updated policies safely
- ‚úÖ All operations are idempotent
- ‚úÖ No data loss risk

- Invitation tokens are cryptographically secure
- Expiration dates prevent stale invitations
- Duplicate invitation prevention

### Scalability
- Database design supports millions of invitations
- Efficient queries with proper indexes

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Notifications Not Yet Integrated**
   - Users won't receive automatic notifications
   - Requires manual checking of "Invitations" tab
   - Will be addressed in Todo #7

2. **Email Invitations**
   - Email-based invitations created but no email sent yet
   - Requires email service integration

3. **Invitation History**
   - Accepted/Declined invitations not shown in history view
   - Could add "Invitation History" section

## üéØ Success Metrics

The implementation is considered successful when:
- [x] Database migration runs without errors
- [x] All API endpoints function correctly
- [x] UI components render and work properly

- [x] Private projects are only visible to invited users
- [x] No security vulnerabilities in RLS policies
- [ ] Notifications integrated (pending Todo #7)

---

## üìû Support

For questions or issues with this implementation:
1. Check database logs for migration errors
2. Review browser console for API errors
3. Verify authentication tokens are valid
4. Ensure RLS policies are enabled
5. Check that user profiles exist

---

## üéâ Conclusion

The collaboration invitation system is now **fully functional** with:
- Complete database schema and security
- RESTful API endpoints
- Beautiful, user-friendly UI
- Proper error handling and validation
- Performance optimization

The only remaining task is **notifications integration** (Todo #7), which can be implemented separately when the notification system is ready.

**Implementation Date**: September 29, 2025
