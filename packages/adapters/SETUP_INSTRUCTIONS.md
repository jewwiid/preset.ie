# Supabase Database Setup Instructions

## Current Status ‚úÖ

- **Connection**: Supabase client connects successfully
- **Authentication**: Service role key is valid and working
- **Services**: Auth and Storage services are accessible
- **Issue**: Database schema not yet created (tables missing)

## Required Action üîß

The database schema needs to be created manually through the Supabase Dashboard.

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zbsmgymyfhnwjdnmlelr/editor

### Step 2: Apply Initial Schema Migration

1. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
2. Click "New query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` 
4. Paste into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 3: Apply RLS Policies Migration

1. Create another new query
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL editor  
4. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Run the verification script to confirm everything is working:

```bash
cd packages/adapters
node src/verify-setup.js
```

## Migration Files Location

- **Initial Schema**: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- **RLS Policies**: `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`

## Expected Tables After Migration

- `users_profile` - User profiles and account info
- `gigs` - Gig postings
- `applications` - Gig applications  
- `media` - Media files and metadata
- `moodboards` - Gig mood boards
- `moodboard_items` - Individual mood board items
- `messages` - Direct messaging
- `showcases` - Portfolio showcases
- `showcase_media` - Media in showcases

Once the schema is applied:

1. ‚úÖ Verify setup with `node src/verify-setup.js`
2. üèóÔ∏è Create and test repository adapters
3. üîê Implement authentication adapters
4. üìÅ Set up storage adapters
