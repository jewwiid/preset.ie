## Missing Components & Gaps

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Route Mismatch Issue
**Equipment Marketplace Route Mismatch:**
- Equipment pages exist at `/gear/` but all links point to `/equipment/`
- This breaks navigation throughout the application
- Need to either:
  1. Move `/gear/` pages to `/equipment/` directory, OR
  2. Update all links to point to `/gear/` instead of `/equipment/`

**Current Equipment Pages (at `/gear/`):**
- ✅ `/gear/page.tsx` - Main equipment marketplace
- ✅ `/gear/create/page.tsx` - Create equipment listing
- ✅ `/gear/my-listings/page.tsx` - User's equipment listings
- ✅ `/gear/orders/page.tsx` - Equipment orders
- ✅ `/gear/offers/page.tsx` - Equipment offers
- ✅ `/gear/requests/page.tsx` - Equipment requests
- ✅ `/gear/reviews/page.tsx` - Equipment reviews
- ✅ `/gear/listings/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual listing view

### ❌ MISSING: Preset Marketplace User Dashboard Pages
1. **My Listings Page** (`/presets/marketplace/my-listings/page.tsx`)

   - View sales analytics
   - Manage listing status

2. **My Purchases Page** (`/presets/marketplace/purchases/page.tsx`)
   - View purchased presets
   - Access to purchased preset files
   - Purchase history

3. **Analytics Dashboard** (`/presets/marketplace/analytics/page.tsx`)
   - Sales performance metrics

## Conclusion

The marketplace has a solid foundation with complete database schema, core API endpoints, and basic frontend functionality. However, several key user-facing features are missing that would complete the marketplace experience. The most critical gaps are:

1. User dashboard pages (My Listings, My Purchases, Analytics)
2. Review system implementation
3. Notification system
4. Preset preview functionality

The core marketplace flow works end-to-end, but users need better tools to manage their marketplace activity and make informed purchasing decisions.
