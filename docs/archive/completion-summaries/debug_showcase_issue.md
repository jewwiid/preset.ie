# 🔍 Debugging Showcase Creation Issue

## ✅ What's Working:
- Database schema is correct
- API logic is sound
- Individual image showcases can be created successfully
- All required tables exist (showcases, showcase_media, showcase_like_counts)

## 🚨 Potential Issues:

### 1. **Authentication Issue**
- Session token might be invalid or expired
- User might not be properly authenticated
- Check browser console for auth errors

### 2. **Frontend Form Validation**
- Form might not be properly filled out
- Required fields might be missing
- Check if `individualImageId` is set when selecting an image

### 3. **API Endpoint Issues**
- Development server might not be running
- API route might have errors
- Check server logs for errors

## 🔧 Debugging Steps:

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try to create a showcase
4. Look for any error messages

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
1. Go to Network tab in developer tools
2. Try to create a showcase
3. Look for the `/api/showcases/create` request
4. Check the request payload and response

### Step 3: Check Form Data
1. Make sure all required fields are filled:
   - Title ✅
   - Description ✅
   - Image selected (for individual image showcases) ✅
   - Tags (optional) ✅

### Step 4: Check Authentication
1. Verify user is logged in
2. Check if session is valid
3. Look for auth-related errors

## 🚀 Quick Fixes to Try:

### Fix 1: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

### Fix 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try in incognito/private mode

### Fix 3: Check Environment Variables
- Make sure `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Fix 4: Test with Different User
- Try logging out and logging back in
- Test with a different user account

## 📋 Test Checklist:

- [ ] User is logged in
- [ ] Form is properly filled out
- [ ] Image is selected for individual image showcase
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] API request is being made
- [ ] Development server is running
- [ ] Environment variables are correct

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Check network tab** for API request details
3. **Verify form data** is being sent correctly
4. **Test authentication** status

The database and API logic are working correctly, so the issue is likely in the frontend or authentication layer.
