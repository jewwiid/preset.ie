# Complete Verification System Implementation

## Overview
Build a GDPR-compliant, free verification system for Preset that allows users to self-verify their identity, age, and professional credentials.

## 1. User-Facing Components Needed

### A. Verification Request Form (`/verify`)
```typescript
// Components to create:
- VerificationTypeSelector (Age, Identity, Professional, Business)
- DocumentUploadForm (secure file upload)
- VerificationProgress (track request status)
- VerificationHistory (view past requests)
```

### B. Profile Integration
```typescript
// Add to user profile:
- VerificationStatus badges
- "Request Verification" CTA
- Verification benefits explanation
```

## 2. Admin Enhancement

### Current Admin View (✅ Working)
- Verification queue showing pending requests
- User info display (Marcus Chen @marcus_model)
- Filter by status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

### Needed Admin Enhancements
```typescript
// Add to VerificationQueue component:
- Document viewer modal
- Verification decision workflow
- Admin notes/comments
- Batch processing
- Audit trail
```

## 3. GDPR-Compliant Architecture

### Document Storage
- **Bucket**: `verification-documents` (private)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 (Supabase default)
- **Access**: Admin-only signed URLs
- **Retention**: Auto-delete after 30 days
- **Logging**: All access logged for audit

### Data Minimization
```sql
-- Only store necessary fields:
verification_requests {
  id, user_id, request_type, status,
  document_url, -- encrypted private URL
  submitted_at, reviewed_at, 
  admin_notes, -- for review process
  expiry_at -- for auto-deletion
}
```

### User Rights (GDPR Articles 15-22)
- **Access**: Users can download their data
- **Rectification**: Users can update information
- **Erasure**: Users can delete verification data
- **Portability**: Export verification status

## 4. Verification Methods (Free & Effective)
