# âœ… Verification System - Final Implementation Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue Resolved: View Column Conflict

The error `cannot change name of view column "user_name" to "verification_data"` has been **resolved** by creating separate, focused SQL scripts.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Implementation

### **Step 1: Add Enhanced Columns**
Run the first SQL script in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) â†’ **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/add-verification-columns-only.sql`
3. Click **Run** to add the enhanced columns

**This will add:**
- âœ… `verification_data` - Type-specific verification metadata
- âœ… `social_links` - Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Portfolio URLs
- âœ… `professional_info` - Experience, license, specializations, references
- âœ… `business_info` - Business name, website, registration, address, tax_id
- âœ… `contact_info` - Phone, alternative email

- âœ… `request_type` - New column for enhanced functionality

### **Step 2: Add Functions and View**
Run the second SQL script in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) â†’ **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/add-verification-functions.sql`
3. Click **Run** to add the functions and recreate the view
