# Development Session Summary - October 14, 2025

## Overview
Completed critical pricing fixes, credit rollover system implementation, gigs map feature, and created comprehensive expansion roadmap.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Credit Pricing System - FIXED & PROFITABLE**

**Problem:**
- NanoBanana charging 1 credit ($0.02) for $0.038 API cost = **-47% margin** (losing money)
- Video generation using variable multipliers not based on actual costs
- Seedance sometimes overcharging 4-9x
- WAN sometimes losing money (12 credits for $0.25 cost)

**Solution:**
- ✅ NanoBanana: 1 → **2 credits** (5% margin, now profitable)
- ✅ Seedream: **2 credits** (48% margin, healthy)
- ✅ Seedance Pro 720p: **12 credits fixed** (60% margin, was 8-18 variable)
- ✅ WAN 2.5: **20 credits fixed** (60% margin, was 12-27 variable)
- ✅ Removed all variable duration/resolution multipliers
- ✅ All pricing now based on actual API costs with 30-60% margins

**Files Changed:**
- [apps/web/lib/credits/constants.ts](../apps/web/lib/credits/constants.ts) - Accurate pricing constants
- [apps/web/app/api/playground/video/route.ts](../apps/web/app/api/playground/video/route.ts) - Fixed video pricing
- [apps/web/app/api/playground/generate/route.ts](../apps/web/app/api/playground/generate/route.ts) - Fixed metadata

**Impact:**
- 🎯 All operations now profitable
- 📊 Predictable, transparent pricing
- 💰 Healthy margins maintained

### 2. **Credit Rollover System - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:**
- Purchased credits were being lost on monthly reset
- No distinction between subscription vs purchased credits
- Refunds not restoring to correct bucket

**Solution:**
✅ **Database Schema**
```sql
-- user_credits table
current_balance              INTEGER  -- Total = subscription + purchased
purchased_credits_balance    INTEGER  -- Never expires
monthly_allowance            INTEGER  -- Resets monthly
consumed_this_month          INTEGER  -- Subscription only
```

✅ **Smart Functions**
- `consume_user_credits()` - Purchased first, then subscription
- `add_purchased_credits()` - Track purchased separately
- `refund_user_credits()` - Subscription first, then purchased
- `reset_monthly_subscription_benefits()` - Preserves purchased credits

✅ **Application Layer**
- Updated `deductUserCredits()` to use smart RPC
- Updated `refundUserCredits()` to restore correctly
- Transaction logging with breakdown
- Fallback for missing functions

**Files Changed:**
- [supabase/migrations/062_fix_purchased_credits_rollover.sql](../supabase/migrations/062_fix_purchased_credits_rollover.sql)
- [supabase/migrations/20251014000001_add_refund_credits_function.sql](../supabase/migrations/20251014000001_add_refund_credits_function.sql)
- [apps/web/lib/credits/index.ts](../apps/web/lib/credits/index.ts)
- [apps/web/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts](../apps/web/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts)

**How It Works:**
1. User purchases credits → added to `purchased_credits_balance`
2. User consumes credits → purchased first, subscription second
3. Monthly reset → `current_balance = monthly_allowance + purchased_credits_balance`
4. **Result:** Purchased credits roll over forever ✅

**Impact:**
- 🎁 Users keep purchased credits indefinitely
- 📊 Accurate tracking of credit types
- 💳 Fair refund handling

### 3. **Gigs Map Discovery - COMPLETE**

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Interactive MapLibre-based map view
- ✅ PostGIS spatial queries (bounding box & radius)
- ✅ GeoJSON clustering for performance
- ✅ Dual view mode (Grid/Map toggle)
- ✅ Sidebar with gig details
- ✅ Real-time map-based filtering

**Technical Stack:**
- MapLibre GL JS for rendering
- PostGIS for spatial queries
- Supabase RPC functions:
  - `get_gigs_in_bbox(min_lng, min_lat, max_lng, max_lat, limit)`
  - `get_gigs_near_point(center_lng, center_lat, radius_meters, limit)`

**Files Created:**
- [apps/web/components/GigsMap.tsx](../apps/web/components/GigsMap.tsx) - Map component
- [apps/web/components/GigsMapSidebar.tsx](../apps/web/components/GigsMapSidebar.tsx) - Sidebar
- [apps/web/app/api/gigs/map/route.ts](../apps/web/app/api/gigs/map/route.ts) - API endpoint
- [docs/features/MAP_DISCOVERY_GUIDE.md](../docs/features/MAP_DISCOVERY_GUIDE.md) - Implementation guide

**Files Modified:**
- [apps/web/app/gigs/page.tsx](../apps/web/app/gigs/page.tsx) - Added map view toggle
- [apps/web/app/gigs/types.ts](../apps/web/app/gigs/types.ts) - Map gig types

**Impact:**
- 🗺️ Geographic gig discovery
- 🎯 Better user experience for location-based search
- 🚀 Scalable PostGIS architecture
