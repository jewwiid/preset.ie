## ðŸš€ How to Send Campaigns

### Method 1: Use Helper Functions (Easiest)

```typescript
import { createTalentCampaign } from '@/lib/services/plunk-campaigns.service';
import { getActorsCampaignTemplate } from '@/lib/services/emails/templates/campaigns.templates';

// Send to all actors
await createTalentCampaign(
  ['Actor', 'Voice Actor', 'Theater Actor'],
  {
    subject: 'New Acting Opportunities',
    body: getActorsCampaignTemplate('Actor', {
      heading: '50+ Acting Gigs Available',
      message: 'From commercials to theater - find your next role!',
      ctaText: 'Browse Gigs',
      ctaUrl: 'https://presetie.com/gigs?talent=actor'
    })
  },
  {
    testEmails: ['you@presetie.com'],  // Test first!
    sendNow: false  // Review before sending
  }
);
```

### Method 2: Use Campaign Service (More Control)

```typescript
import { PlunkCampaignsService } from '@/lib/services/plunk-campaigns.service';

const service = new PlunkCampaignsService();

await service.createCampaign({
  name: 'LA Videographers Campaign',
  targeting: {
    specializations: ['Cinematography', 'Video Production'],
    cities: ['Los Angeles'],
    verified: true,
    active: true  // Active in last 30 days
  },
  content: {
    subject: 'Premium Video Projects in LA',
    body: '...your HTML email...'
  },
  testEmails: ['you@presetie.com'],
  sendNow: false
});
```

### Method 3: Use API Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST https://presetie.com/api/campaigns/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Actors Campaign",
    "targeting": {
      "talentCategories": ["Actor"]
    },
    "content": {
      "subject": "New Opportunities",
      "body": "<html>...</html>"
    },
    "testEmails": ["you@presetie.com"]
  }'
```
