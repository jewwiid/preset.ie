## Next Steps - Phase 3

### Model Pricing System (Not Yet Started)

**Goal**: Implement tiered model pricing for video generation

**Models to integrate**:
```
Budget tier:    Seedream V4     - $0.027/video (2 credits)
Standard tier:  WAN 2.5         - $0.25/video  (20 credits)
Premium tier:   Sora 2          - $0.40/video  (30 credits)
Ultra tier:     Sora 2 Pro      - $1.20/video  (90 credits)
```

**Tasks**:
1. Create model pricing constants
2. Add model selector UI with tier badges
3. Gate premium models to appropriate subscription tiers
4. Update video generation API to use new pricing
5. Add model usage tracking/analytics

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

## Known Issues

### Stripe Price IDs - Action Required

**Issue**: All Stripe price IDs are placeholder values (e.g., `price_starter_pack`)

**Files affected**:
- `apps/web/lib/stripe.ts` (lines 19, 27, 35, 44, 52, 60)

**Action required**:
1. Create products in Stripe Dashboard for each package
2. Create prices for each product
3. Copy actual price IDs (e.g., `price_1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J`)
4. Replace placeholder values in `stripe.ts`

**Note**: Until real price IDs are added, checkout will fail. Use Stripe's price_data method as fallback (already implemented in checkout route).

## Success Metrics to Track

After deploying Phase 2, monitor:

1. **Conversion Rate**: % of FREE users upgrading to paid
   - Target: 10%+ conversion within 30 days

2. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**:
   - Current: Estimate with new pricing
   - Target: $15-25/mo across all paying users

3. **Credit Package Sales**:
   - Track which packages sell best
   - Hypothesis: "Popular" pack (50cr @ $8.99) will be top seller

4. **CREATOR Tier Adoption**:
   - Track how many users upgrade to $49.99/mo tier
   - Monitor churn rate (should be <5% monthly)

5. **Free Credit Utilization**:
   - Track if FREE users use all 15 credits
   - If <50% utilization, consider reducing to 10 credits
