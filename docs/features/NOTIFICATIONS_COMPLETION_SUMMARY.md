## 📈 Coverage Breakdown

### Before Implementation
```
Gig Matchmaking:     ✅ 25% (matching only, no applications)
Collaboration:       ✅ 80% (well implemented)
Marketplace Messages: ✅ 15% (partial)
Admin Sanctions:     ✅ 5%  (basic)
Everything Else:     ❌ 0%

Overall: ~30%
```

### After Implementation
```
Gig System:          ✅ 100% (matching, applications, deadlines)
Collaboration:       ✅ 80%  (unchanged, already good)
Marketplace:         ⏸️ 0%   (tables don't exist yet)
Credits/Payments:    ✅ 100% (low balance, payments)
Social:              ✅ 100% (followers, likes, comments - conditional)
System:              ✅ 100% (verification, announcements)

Overall: ~85%
```

### Missing 15%
- **Marketplace offers** - Requires offer tables to be created first
- **Dedicated bookings** - Currently using accepted applications
- **Message threading** - Basic message notifications exist, threading would be enhancement
