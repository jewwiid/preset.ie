## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Push all migrations
supabase db push --linked
```

**Note**: May encounter duplicate policy error in old migration 061. This is safe to ignore - our new migrations will still apply.

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution (What you did)

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor in order:
1. ✅ 20251008000001_gig_application_notifications.sql
2. ✅ 20251008000002_credit_notifications.sql
3. ✅ 20251008000004_social_notifications.sql
4. ✅ 20251008000005_system_notifications.sql
5. ✅ 20251008000006_message_notifications.sql
6. ✅ 20251008000007_preset_usage_notifications.sql
7. ✅ 20251008000008_marketplace_notifications.sql
8. ⏳ 20251008000010_fix_preset_liked_function.sql *(NEEDS TO BE RUN)*

## ⚡ Quick Verification

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to see all active triggers:

```sql
SELECT
  trigger_name,
  event_object_table,
  action_timing,
  event_manipulation
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
AND trigger_name LIKE 'trigger_notify_%'
ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;
```

**Expected Result**: Should show 8-9 triggers (9 if preset_liked is deployed)

---

## 🎯 Admin Tools Available

### Platform Announcements

```sql
-- Send to all users
SELECT send_platform_announcement(
  '🎉 New Feature: Enhanced Matchmaking',
  'Our new role-based matchmaking algorithm helps you find perfect collaborators!',
  '/features/matchmaking'
);

-- Send to specific users (e.g., all talent in Dublin)
SELECT send_targeted_announcement(
  '📸 Dublin Photo Walk This Weekend',
  'Join us for a photographer meetup this Saturday!',
  ARRAY['TALENT'],  -- role filter
  'Dublin',         -- city filter
  '/events/dublin-photo-walk'
);
```
