## Matchmaking Algorithm

### Compatibility Scoring

The `calculate_gig_compatibility()` function calculates a compatibility score (0-100) based on:

1. **Gender Compatibility** (20 points)
   - Matches user's gender identity with gig requirements
   - No penalty if no gender requirements specified

2. **Age Compatibility** (20 points)
   - Checks if user's age falls within gig's age range
   - No penalty if no age requirements specified

3. **Height Compatibility** (15 points)
   - Matches user's height with gig's height requirements
   - No penalty if no height requirements specified

4. **Experience Compatibility** (25 points)
   - Compares user's years of experience with gig requirements
   - No penalty if no experience requirements specified

5. **Specialization Compatibility** (20 points)
   - Calculates percentage of required specializations that user has
   - Weighted by number of matching specializations

### Minimum Compatibility Threshold

- **60% compatibility score** required for recommendations
- Ensures only genuinely compatible matches are suggested
- Prevents low-quality matches from cluttering results

## Helper Functions

### 1. `find_compatible_users_for_gig(gig_id, limit)`
Finds users compatible with a specific gig.

**Returns:**
- `profile_id`: User's profile ID
- `compatibility_score`: Calculated compatibility score
- `match_factors`: Detailed breakdown of match factors
- `display_name`: User's display name
- `city`: User's city

### 2. `find_compatible_gigs_for_user(profile_id, limit)`
Finds gigs compatible with a specific user.

**Returns:**
- `gig_id`: Gig ID
- `compatibility_score`: Calculated compatibility score
- `match_factors`: Detailed breakdown of match factors
- `title`: Gig title
- `location_text`: Gig location
- `start_time`: Gig start time

## Privacy and Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Public Demographics**: Only shows fields marked as public by user
- **Private Information**: Demographics only visible to user themselves
- **Specializations**: Publicly visible for matchmaking
- **Work Preferences**: Publicly visible for gig matching
- **Gig Requirements**: Publicly visible for user matching

### Privacy Controls
- `show_age`: Control age visibility
- `show_location`: Control location visibility  
- `show_physical_attributes`: Control physical attribute visibility

### Data Validation
- Age constraints (18+ minimum)
- Height/weight reasonable ranges
- Experience years validation
- Travel radius validation

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- **Demographic Indexes**: Gender, ethnicity, age, height, location
- **Specialization Indexes**: Category-based and user-based lookups
- **Compatibility Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for complex queries
- **GIN Indexes**: For array fields (specializations, requirements)

### Query Optimization
- **Lateral Joins**: Efficient compatibility calculations
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for common query patterns
- **Partial Indexes**: Indexes on filtered subsets (active records only)

## Usage Examples

### Finding Compatible Users for a Gig

```sql
-- Find users compatible with a specific gig
SELECT * FROM find_compatible_users_for_gig('gig-uuid-here', 10);
```

### Finding Compatible Gigs for a User

```sql
-- Find gigs compatible with a specific user
SELECT * FROM find_compatible_gigs_for_user('profile-uuid-here', 10);

    profile_id, gender_identity, ethnicity, nationality, 
    height_cm, years_experience, country, city
) VALUES (
    'profile-uuid', 'female', 'asian', 'American',
    165, 3, 'United States', 'New York'
);
```

### Adding User Specializations

```sql
-- Add user specializations
INSERT INTO user_specializations (
    profile_id, specialization_id, skill_level, years_experience, is_primary
) VALUES (
    'profile-uuid', 'specialization-uuid', 'intermediate', 2, true
);
```

### Setting Gig Requirements

```sql
-- Set gig requirements
INSERT INTO gig_requirements (
    gig_id, required_gender, age_range_min, age_range_max,
    height_range_min, height_range_max, required_years_experience
) VALUES (
    'gig-uuid', ARRAY['female'], 20, 35, 160, 180, 2
);
```
