# 🚀 Deploy Marketplace Notifications - Step by Step

## Overview
This will activate marketplace notifications by creating the required tables and cleaning up unused social notification functions.

---

## 📋 Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Create Marketplace Tables
Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251008000011_marketplace_tables_for_notifications.sql`

**What it does:**
- Creates `preset_marketplace_listings` table
- Creates `preset_purchases` table
- Creates `preset_reviews` table
- Adds marketplace columns to `presets` table
- Sets up RLS policies and indexes
- **Auto-activates 3 notification triggers**

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Marketplace tables created successfully
✅ 3 marketplace notification triggers activated
```

---

### Step 2: Clean Up Unused Functions
Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251008000012_cleanup_unused_social_notifications.sql`

**What it does:**
- Removes `notify_new_follower()` (we don't have followers)
- Removes `notify_showcase_liked()` (showcases don't have this)
- Removes `notify_showcase_comment()` (showcases don't have this)
- Removes `notify_profile_incomplete()` (optional feature not used)

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Cleaned up unused social notification functions
📊 Remaining notification functions: 12
```
