# 💳 Credit Purchase & Sync System

## Critical Understanding: The 1:4 Ratio

### User vs Platform Credits
- **1 User Credit** = **4 NanoBanana Credits**
- User buys 10 credits → Platform needs 40 NanoBanana credits
- User buys 100 credits → Platform needs 400 NanoBanana credits

## Current Platform Capacity

With **938 NanoBanana credits**, the platform can sell:
- **Maximum**: 234 user credits (938 ÷ 4)
- **Starter Pack (10)**: ✅ Can sell 23 packages
- **Creative Bundle (50)**: ✅ Can sell 4 packages  
- **Pro Pack (100)**: ✅ Can sell 2 packages
- **Studio Pack (500)**: ❌ Cannot sell (needs 2000 NanoBanana credits)

## How Credit Purchase Works

### 1. User Wants to Buy Credits
```javascript
User clicks "Buy 50 credits for €39.99"
                    ↓
System checks: Do we have 200 NanoBanana credits?
                    ↓
YES → Proceed with purchase
NO  → Block purchase & alert admin
```

### 2. Platform Capacity Check (CRITICAL!)
```typescript
// API: GET /api/credits/purchase
{
  platformCapacity: {
    totalUserCredits: 234,      // Max we can sell
    nanoBananaCredits: 938,     // Actual platform balance
    canSellStarter: true,       // 10 credits
    canSellCreative: true,      // 50 credits
    canSellPro: true,          // 100 credits
    canSellStudio: false       // 500 credits - NOT ENOUGH!
  }
}
```

### 3. Purchase Flow with Safety Checks

```typescript
// When user buys credits:

1. CHECK PLATFORM CAPACITY
   if (userCredits * 4 > platformNanoBananaCredits) {
     BLOCK PURCHASE - "Service temporarily unavailable"
   }

2. GIVE USER CREDITS
   user.balance += purchasedCredits

3. RESERVE PLATFORM CREDITS
   // Track that these NanoBanana credits are "spoken for"
   platform_consumption.log({
     operation: 'credit_purchase_reservation',
     user_credits: 50,
     provider_credits: 200  // Reserved for this user
   })

4. ALERT IF LOW
   if (remaining < 100) {
     ALERT ADMIN: "Platform running low after sale!"
   }
```

## ⚠️ Critical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Buys More Than Platform Has
```
Platform has: 938 NanoBanana (234 user credits)
User wants: 500 credits (Studio Pack)
Needed: 2000 NanoBanana credits
Result: ❌ PURCHASE BLOCKED
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Users Buy Credits
```
Platform has: 938 NanoBanana
User A buys: 100 credits (uses 400 NanoBanana)
Remaining: 538 NanoBanana (134 user credits)
User B buys: 100 credits (uses 400 NanoBanana)
Remaining: 138 NanoBanana (34 user credits)
User C wants: 50 credits
Result: ❌ NOT ENOUGH - Only 34 available!
```

### Scenario 3: Platform Runs Out
```
If NanoBanana credits = 0:
- No user can enhance images
- No user can buy credits
- Platform is DEAD until admin refills
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Capacity Check Before Sale**
```typescript
// Check before showing packages
GET /api/credits/purchase

// Disables packages that can't be fulfilled
if (package.userCredits > availableCapacity) {
  package.disabled = true;
  package.message = "Temporarily unavailable";
}
```

### 2. **Real-Time Sync**
```typescript
// Admin Dashboard - Credits Tab
"🔄 Sync Real Credits" → Fetches actual NanoBanana balance
Shows: Real API credits vs Database credits
```

### 3. **Alert System**
- Low balance warnings (< 100 credits)
- Critical alerts (< 40 credits)
- Purchase blocked alerts
- Post-sale capacity warnings

## Admin Actions Required

### When Platform is Low (<100 NanoBanana credits):
1. **Immediate**: Stop selling large packages
2. **Alert Users**: "Limited availability"
3. **Purchase More**: Buy NanoBanana credits ASAP

### To Add More Platform Credits:
1. Go to https://nanobananaapi.ai
2. Purchase credit package (recommend 10,000+)
3. Click "Sync Real Credits" in admin dashboard
4. Platform capacity automatically updates

## Revenue vs Cost Analysis

### Current Capacity (938 NanoBanana = 234 user credits)
```
If we sell all 234 credits:
- Revenue: ~€163.80 (at €0.70/credit average)
- Cost: €0.938 (938 × €0.001 estimated)
- Profit: €162.86 (99.4% margin)

BUT: Platform is then EMPTY and cannot operate!
```

### Recommended Buffer
- **Minimum Reserve**: 400 NanoBanana (100 user credits)
- **Comfortable Reserve**: 2000 NanoBanana (500 user credits)
- **Ideal Reserve**: 10,000+ NanoBanana (2,500 user credits)

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Platform Capacity
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/credits/purchase
```

### Check Real NanoBanana Balance
```bash
curl https://api.nanobananaapi.ai/api/v1/common/credit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer e0847916744535b2241e366dbca9a465"
```

### Sync in Admin Dashboard
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Credits tab
3. Click "🔄 Sync Real Credits"
4. View capacity warnings

## Emergency Procedures

### If Platform Runs Out:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** disable all credit purchases
2. Alert all users: "Enhancement temporarily unavailable"
3. Purchase NanoBanana credits urgently
4. Sync and verify capacity restored
5. Re-enable purchases

### Prevention:
- Set auto-alert at 500 NanoBanana credits
