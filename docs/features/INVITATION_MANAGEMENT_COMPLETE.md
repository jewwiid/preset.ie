# Invitation Management - Complete Implementation ✅

## 🎯 Question Answered

**"Where can the creator manage invitations for the gig? Like since Sarah sent an invitation to James, what happens next, how does it progress?"**

## 📋 Current State

### ❌ Before (What Was Missing):
- Gig creators had **NO WAY** to see invitations they sent
- Collaboration project creators had **NO WAY** to track sent invitations
- Invitation system was **one-way**: Sender sends → Receiver sees → No feedback to sender
- Creators couldn't track:
  - Who they invited
  - Invitation status (pending/accepted/declined)
  - When invitations were sent
  - Who responded and how

### ✅ After (What Now Exists):

## 🎯 Gig Invitation Flow - Complete

### 1️⃣ Sarah Sends Invitation to James
- **Where**: James's profile page
- **Component**: `InviteToGigDialog.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Select gig from dropdown
  - See "✓ Already Invited" for duplicate prevention
  - See "⚠️ Deadline Passed" for closed gigs
  - Add personal message

### 2️⃣ Invitation is Processed
- **API**: `POST /api/gigs/[gigId]/invitations`
- **Validation**:
  - ✅ Checks privacy settings (`allow_gig_invites`)
  - ✅ Prevents duplicates (409 if exists)
  - ✅ Validates application deadline
  - ✅ Only gig owners can invite
- **Database**: Record in `gig_invitations` table

### 3️⃣ James Receives Invitation
- **Where**: James's Dashboard
- **Component**: `PendingGigInvitationsCard.tsx`
- **Actions**: Accept & Apply OR Decline

### 4️⃣ **Sarah Tracks Invitation** ✅ NEW
- **Where**: Gig detail page
- **Component**: `SentGigInvitationsCard.tsx` **(newly created)**
- **Shows**:
  - All invitations sent for this gig
  - Status badges:
    - ⏳ Pending (yellow)
    - ✅ Accepted (green)
    - ❌ Declined (red)
    - ⏰ Expired (gray)
  - Invitee details (name, avatar, skill)
  - Personal message sent
  - Timeline (sent date, expiration)
  - Quick actions:
    - "View Profile" for accepted invitations
    - "Waiting for response" for pending

### 5️⃣ Progression After Response
- **James Accepts**: 
  - Status → `'accepted'`
  - Sarah sees ✅ badge in her tracking card
  - James redirected to apply for gig
  - Sarah can click "View Profile" to see James's profile

- **James Declines**:
  - Status → `'declined'`
  - Sarah sees ❌ badge in her tracking card
  - James's invitation removed from his dashboard

- **30 Days Pass**:
  - Status → `'expired'`
  - Sarah sees ⏰ badge
  - Both sides can see it expired

## 🤝 Collaboration Invitation Flow - Complete

### Same 5-Step Process:

1. **Creator sends invitation** (from profile or project page)
2. **Invitation processed** (`POST /api/collab/projects/[id]/invitations`)
3. **Member receives** (Dashboard → `PendingInvitationsCard`)
4. **Creator tracks** (`SentCollabInvitationsCard.tsx` ✅ NEW)
5. **Member responds** → Creator sees status update

### Additional Collaboration Features:
- ✅ **Email invitations**: Can invite non-registered users
- ✅ **Role assignment**: Specify project role
- ✅ **Email indicator**: Shows "Email invitation (user not registered)"
