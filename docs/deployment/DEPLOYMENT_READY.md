```

## 📧 EMAIL CATEGORIES

Users can control these independently:

| Category | What It Includes | Default | Required? |
|----------|------------------|---------|-----------|
| **Gig Notifications** | Gig published, deadlines | ON | No |
| **Application Updates** | Status changes, bookings | ON | No |
| **Messages** | New messages, replies | ON | No |
| **Booking & Collaboration** | Reminders, showcases | ON | No |
| **Account & System** | Security, billing | ON | Yes (critical) |
| **Marketing & Tips** | **Your 36 campaigns** | **OFF** | **No (opt-in)** |

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### **Week 1: Build Opt-In List**

Send ONE campaign to ALL users asking them to opt-in:

**Subject:** "Want Creative Tips & Feature Updates?"

**Body:** Simple, clear value proposition
- Early access to features
- Pro tips from creatives
- Success stories
- Exclusive offers

**CTA:** "Yes, Send Me Tips" → Sets `marketing_notifications = true`

**Expected:** 10-20% opt-in rate (this is GOOD!)

---

### **Week 2: Send to Opted-In Users**

Now send your 36 campaigns to users who opted in:

```typescript
// The service automatically filters!
await service.createCampaign({
  targeting: { talentCategories: ['Model'] },
  content: { subject: '...', body: '...' }
});
// Only sends to Models who opted into marketing ✅
```
