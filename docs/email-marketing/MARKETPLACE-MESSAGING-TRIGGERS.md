psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251009140000_marketplace_email_triggers.sql
```

### Step 2: Enable Scheduled Jobs
```sql
-- Unread messages digest (9 AM and 5 PM)
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'unread-messages-digest',
  '0 9,17 * * *',
  'SELECT send_unread_messages_digest()'
);

-- Sales milestones (daily at 10 AM)
SELECT cron.schedule(
