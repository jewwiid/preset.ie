## Anti-Spam Benefits

### What We Prevent:

‚ùå **Bot signups**
- Requires email access to verify

‚ùå **Disposable email abuse**
- User must receive and click email

‚ùå **Multiple fake accounts**
- Each needs unique, accessible email

### What Users Get:

‚úÖ **Clean, active community**
- All users are real, verified people

‚úÖ **Trusted connections**
- Know everyone verified their email

‚úÖ **Better security**
- Reduces spam messages/gigs

---

## Technical Implementation

### No Profile = No Access

**Protected routes check:**
```typescript
if (!profile) {
  // User hasn't verified email
  redirect('/auth/verification-pending')
}
```

**Applied to:**
- Dashboard
- Gigs
- Marketplace
- Messages
- All user actions

### Sign In Flow

```
User enters credentials
‚Üì
Auth succeeds (user exists in auth.users)
‚Üì
Check for profile in users_profile
‚Üì
No profile? ‚Üí /auth/verification-pending
‚Üì
Profile exists? ‚Üí /dashboard
```

### Verification Token Security

**Format**: `{userId}:{timestamp}:{randomString}`

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Valid UUID for userId
- ‚úÖ Timestamp within 24 hours
- ‚úÖ Three-part format

**Security:**
- Tokens expire (24 hours)
- One-time use (email_verified can't go TRUE ‚Üí TRUE)
- Server-side validation only
- HTTPS only in production

---

## Monitoring

### Check Unverified Users

```sql
SELECT 
  au.email,
  au.created_at as signup_date,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - au.created_at))/3600 as hours_since_signup
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN users_profile up ON au.id = up.user_id
WHERE up.id IS NULL
ORDER BY au.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Verification Emails Sent

```sql
SELECT 
  payload->>'email' as email,
  payload->>'name' as name,
  status,
  created_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN status = 'sent' THEN '‚úÖ'
    WHEN status = 'failed' THEN '‚ùå'
    ELSE '‚è≥'
  END as status_icon
FROM email_logs
WHERE endpoint = '/api/emails/verify-email'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Verification Conversion Rate

```sql
-- Total signups vs verified users
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT au.id) as total_signups,
  COUNT(DISTINCT up.id) as verified_users,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT up.id)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT au.id), 0) * 100, 2) as verification_rate
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN users_profile up ON au.id = up.user_id;
```
