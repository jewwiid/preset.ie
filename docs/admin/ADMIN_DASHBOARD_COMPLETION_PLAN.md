## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React components with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React hooks + SWR for caching
- **API**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for live updates
- **Auth**: Role-based access with RLS

### Key Libraries
- `react-hook-form` - Form handling
- `swr` - Data fetching & caching
- `date-fns` - Date manipulation
- `react-hot-toast` - Notifications
- `@tanstack/react-table` - Data tables

### Security Considerations
- Admin actions require 2FA (future)
- All actions logged
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations
- Input sanitization
- CSRF protection

---

## 🚀 Implementation Order

1. **Start with Reports System** (highest priority)
   - Most critical for safety
   - Foundation for other features
   
2. **Then User Management**
   - Needed for enforcement
   - Connects to reports
   
3. **Follow with Content Moderation**
   - Builds on reports
   - Uses user management
   
4. **Finish with Verification**
   - Lower priority for MVP
   - Can be manual initially

---

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Scalability
- Design for 10,000+ reports/month
- Pagination everywhere
- Efficient database queries
- Caching strategy

### Legal Compliance
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Clear audit trails
- User notification requirements
- Data retention policies

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- AI-powered content moderation
- Automated report categorization
- Shadowban implementation
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Team collaboration features
- Moderation queue assignment
