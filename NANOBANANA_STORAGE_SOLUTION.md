# NanoBanana Image Storage Solution

## üîç Issue Analysis

The enhanced images from NanoBanana were not saving to Supabase buckets due to **callback URL accessibility issues**. Here's what we discovered:

### Root Cause
1. **SSL Certificate Issue**: The production callback URL `https://preset.ie/api/nanobanana/callback` has SSL certificate problems
2. **Callback Not Reached**: NanoBanana cannot reach our callback URL, so completed tasks are never processed
3. **Tasks Stuck in Processing**: 8 tasks were stuck in "processing" status with no result URLs

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- **Supabase Storage**: Perfect - uploads, public URLs, file access all work
- **Callback Handler**: Perfect - processes images correctly when called
- **NanoBanana API**: Working - submits tasks successfully
- **Database Schema**: Correct - stores tasks and tracks status

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper handling for 402 insufficient credits errors
- Better error messages for users
- Debug logging for API responses

### 2. Callback URL Configuration
- Added `NANOBANANA_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable support
- Fallback chain: `NANOBANANA_CALLBACK_URL` ‚Üí `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` ‚Üí `VERCEL_URL` ‚Üí `localhost:3000`
- Better URL construction logic

### 3. Task Cleanup
- Cleaned up stuck tasks older than 1 hour
- Refunded credits for failed tasks
- Marked timed-out tasks as failed

## üöÄ How to Fix the Callback Issue

### Option 1: Use ngrok (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Install ngrok
# Download from https://ngrok.com/download

# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 3000

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Add to your .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

### Option 2: Use a Webhook Service
```bash
# Go to https://webhook.site
# Copy the unique URL
# Add to your .env.local:
NANOBANANA_CALLBACK_URL=https://webhook.site/your-unique-id
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel/Netlify with proper SSL
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to your production domain
```

## üß™ Testing the Solution

### 1. Test Callback Handler
```bash
node test-callback-manual.js
```

### 2. Test Complete Flow
```bash
# Start your app with ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Update .env.local with ngrok URL
# Test enhancement in the UI
```

### 3. Verify Storage
```bash
node check-enhancement-tasks.js
```

## üìã Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Fixed 402 credits error
- ‚úÖ **Callback Handler**: Working perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Storage System**: Working perfectly  
- ‚úÖ **Task Cleanup**: Completed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Callback URL**: Needs HTTPS tunnel (ngrok recommended)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up ngrok tunnel** for development
2. **Update environment variables** with working callback URL
3. **Test enhancement flow** end-to-end
4. **Deploy to production** with proper SSL for permanent solution

## üîß Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
NANOBANANA_API_KEY=your_nanobanana_key

# Callback URL (choose one)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
# OR
NANOBANANA_CALLBACK_URL=https://webhook.site/your-unique-id
```

The system is now properly configured and will work once you provide a reachable HTTPS callback URL.
