## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your Vercel environment:

```bash
# Required for cron jobs
CRON_SECRET=<generate-random-secret>

# Supabase credentials (should already exist)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-key>
```

**Generate CRON_SECRET**:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 2. Database Prerequisites
Verify these tables exist:
- ‚úÖ `notifications` (required)
- ‚úÖ `notification_preferences` (required)
- ‚úÖ `applications` (required for gig notifications)
- ‚úÖ `user_credits` (required for credit notifications)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `user_follows` (optional - follower notifications)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `showcases`, `showcase_likes`, `showcase_comments` (optional - social)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `saved_gigs` (optional - deadline reminders work better with this)

### 3. Verify Migrations Are Ready
```bash
# List migrations to deploy
ls -la supabase/migrations/20251008*

# Should show:
# 20251008000001_gig_application_notifications.sql
# 20251008000002_credit_notifications.sql
# 20251008000004_social_notifications.sql

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# Run migrations (dry run first to check)
npx supabase db push --dry-run

# If all looks good, run for real
npx supabase db push

# Verify triggers were created
npx supabase db execute --file - <<SQL
SELECT
  trigger_name,
  event_object_table,
  action_timing,
  event_manipulation
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
  AND trigger_name LIKE '%notify%'
ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;
SQL
```

**Expected Output**:
```
trigger_name                              | event_object_table      | action_timing | event_manipulation
------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------
trigger_notify_gig_application_received   | applications            | AFTER         | INSERT

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test 1: Application Received Notification

**Steps**:
1. Create a test gig as User A
2. Publish the gig
3. Apply to the gig as User B
4. Check User A's notifications

**Expected Result**:
```
Notification:
  Title: "New application for <gig-title>"
  Message: "<applicant-name> applied for your <gig-purpose> gig"
  Action URL: /gigs/<gig-id>/applications
  Category: gig
  Type: new_application

   UPDATE user_credits SET credits = 9 WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
   ```
3. Check user's notifications

**Expected Result**:
```
Notification:
  Title: "‚ö†Ô∏è Low credit balance"
  Message: "You have 9 credits remaining. ..."
  Action URL: /credits/purchase
```

**Test critical threshold**:

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/cron/gig-deadline-reminders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deadline reminders processed successfully",
  "gigsProcessed": 2,
  "remindersSent": 5,
  "usersNotified": 5
}

  'üì∏ Dublin Photo Walk',
  'Join us this Saturday!',
  ARRAY['TALENT'],
  'Dublin',
  '/events/dublin-photo-walk'
);
```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Notification Delivery

```sql
-- Count notifications by type (last 24 hours)
SELECT
  type,
  category,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM notifications
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY type, category
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Check Unread Notifications

```sql
-- Users with most unread notifications
SELECT
  recipient_id,
  COUNT(*) as unread_count
FROM notifications
WHERE read_at IS NULL
GROUP BY recipient_id
ORDER BY unread_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Trigger Performance

```sql
-- Check if triggers are firing
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('notifications', 'applications', 'user_credits')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

### Check Cron Job Logs

**Vercel Dashboard**:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click latest deployment
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Find `/api/cron/gig-deadline-reminders`
5. View logs

**Or via CLI**:
```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

### Check for Errors

```bash
# Check Supabase logs
npx supabase logs --db postgres

# Filter for notification errors
npx supabase logs | grep -i "notification"
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Notifications Not Appearing

**Check 1: Preferences**
```sql
SELECT * FROM notification_preferences
WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
```
Ensure `in_app_enabled = true` and relevant category is enabled.

**Check 2: Triggers Installed**
```sql
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = 'applications';
```

**Check 3: Real-time Disabled**
The notifications will work via manual refresh. Real-time is disabled in the hook.

### Issue: Cron Job Not Running

**Check 1: CRON_SECRET set**
```bash
vercel env ls
```

**Check 2: Cron registered**
Check Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Crons tab

**Check 3: Test endpoint manually**
```bash
curl -X GET https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/cron/gig-deadline-reminders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

### Issue: Duplicate Notifications

**Cause**: Triggers firing multiple times

**Fix**: Check if triggers are defined multiple times:
```sql
SELECT trigger_name, COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
GROUP BY trigger_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

If duplicates found, drop and recreate:
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_notify_gig_application_received ON applications;
```
Then re-run migration.

### Issue: Performance Degradation

**Check query performance**:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM notifications
WHERE recipient_id = '<user-id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Add indexes if needed**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_notifications_recipient_created
ON notifications(recipient_id, created_at DESC);
```
