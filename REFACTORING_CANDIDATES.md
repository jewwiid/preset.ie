   - High impact: used frequently in playground
   - Clear refactoring path with existing patterns
   - **Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

2. **MediaMetadataModal.tsx** (1,356 lines)
   - High reusability: metadata editing is common
   - Clear section boundaries
   - **Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

3. **CreateShowcaseModal.tsx** (1,172 lines)
   - Can reuse patterns from CreateRequestModal
   - Similar multi-step form structure
   - **Estimated effort:** 3-5 hours

4. **VideoGenerationPanel.tsx** (1,327 lines)
   - Complex but high value feature
   - Could improve UX with better organization
   - **Estimated effort:** 5-7 hours

5. **SavedImagesMasonry.tsx** (1,269 lines)
   - Performance opportunity with virtualization

## 💡 Key Patterns to Reuse

From our successful Phase 1-3 refactoring:

✅ **Custom Hooks Pattern**
- `useXData` for data fetching (useEquipmentData, useProfileStats)
- `useXForm` for form state (useRequestForm, useListingForm)
- `useXActions` for actions (like, delete, save)

✅ **Component Extraction Pattern**
- Break down by responsibility (filters, cards, forms)
- Create reusable UI components (RangeInput, MultiSelectChips)
- Use section wrappers for consistency (PreferenceSection)

✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Data fetching in hooks
- Business logic in utilities
- UI rendering in components
- State management in contexts/hooks

## 📊 Potential Total Impact

If all Phase 4 recommendations are completed:

| Metric | Current | After Phase 4 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Total Lines (Top 5) | 6,571 | ~1,900 | -4,671 (-71%) |
| Large Files (1000+) | 15 files | ~8 files | -7 files |
| Reusable Components | 30+ | 50+ | +20 |
| Custom Hooks | 9 | 15+ | +6 |

**Combined with Phase 1-3:**
- Total lines reduced: ~7,077 lines
- Total components created: 50+
- Total hooks created: 15+

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Not Critical:** The primary 6-file refactoring is complete. These are optional improvements.

2. **Diminishing Returns:** Some files are large but well-organized. Focus on files with clear complexity issues.

3. **Business Priority:** Prioritize based on:
   - Feature usage frequency
   - Team pain points
   - Planned feature additions

4. **Testing:** Each refactoring should include:
   - Manual testing of all features
   - Backup files (.backup extension)
   - Gradual rollout if possible
