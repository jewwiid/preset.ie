# Database Safety Rules

## FORBIDDEN COMMANDS (Never run without explicit user permission):
- `supabase db reset`
- `supabase db push --include-all`
- `DROP DATABASE`
- `TRUNCATE`
- `DELETE FROM table_name` (without WHERE)
- Any command with `--force` or `--yes` that could be destructive

## REQUIRED SAFETY CHECKS:
1. Before running ANY database command, ask: "This command will [explain what it does]. Are you sure you want to proceed?"
2. Always suggest safer alternatives first
3. Never assume the user wants to lose data
4. Always explain the consequences of destructive operations

## SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
- Use `CREATE OR REPLACE` instead of `DROP` + `CREATE`
- Run individual SQL files instead of full migrations
- Use `ALTER TABLE` for schema changes
- Always backup before major changes
