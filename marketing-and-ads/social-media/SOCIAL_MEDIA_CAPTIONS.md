The Future of Creative Hiring: How I Found a Makeup Artist in 2 Minutes

Yesterday, my makeup artist cancelled for today's brand photoshoot. I was in full panic mode.

Traditional approach would have been:
• Hours of Instagram research
• Dozens of cold DMs
• Hoping for quick responses
• No verification of credentials

Instead, I posted on Preset Platform:
✅ 2 minutes to post the gig
✅ 8 qualified applicants within the hour
✅ Full portfolios and verified reviews
✅ Direct communication with talent

I hired an artist who's worked with brands I admire. Shoot is happening today as planned.

The creative industry is evolving. Platforms like Preset are making talent discovery efficient, transparent, and actually enjoyable.

For fellow creative directors and producers: How are you currently finding freelance talent? What's your biggest challenge?

Building a Creative Network in 2025: Quality Over Quantity

In one month on Preset, I've connected with more quality creative professionals in Cork than I did in a year of LinkedIn networking.

The difference?

Traditional networking:
❌ Generic connection requests
❌ One-dimensional profiles
❌ No work samples
❌ Endless back-and-forth

Preset networking:
✅ Portfolio-first introductions
✅ Skills and specializations visible
✅ Mutual collaboration interests
✅ Direct project opportunities

I've now built relationships with a videographer, product photographer, and brand designer - all local, all talented, all actively collaborating on client projects.

For creative professionals: Where are you building your network? What platforms actually lead to real collaboration?

From Zero to Fully Booked: My 90-Day Journey as a Commercial Photographer

Three months ago:
• Zero paid photography work
• Doing TFP shoots for portfolio
• Questioning if I could make this a career

Today:
• €3,500-5,000 monthly revenue
• Fully booked for next 2 weeks
• Every client found through Preset Platform

What changed?

I stopped waiting for opportunities and started putting myself out there. Preset gave me the platform to:

1. Showcase my work professionally
2. Connect directly with brands and agencies
3. Build credibility through reviews
4. Set clear rates and filter serious clients

For creatives struggling to monetize: The work is there. The clients are there. You just need to be visible in the right places.

My advice:
✅ Build a strong portfolio
✅ Set clear rates
✅ Be professional in communication
✅ Deliver exceptional work
✅ Let your work compound

What's your biggest challenge in finding paid creative work? Let's discuss in comments.

- Tag @preset.ie or mention "Preset"

- Use emojis strategically (not overboard)
- Ask questions to drive engagement
- Include social proof when possible

### ❌ DON'Ts:
- Don't put link in caption (Instagram won't show it)
- Don't use banned hashtags (#followback, #like4like)
- Don't make caption longer than video content
- Don't use all caps (except for emphasis)
- Don't forget platform-specific conventions
- Don't repeat same caption across all videos
- Don't forget to localize (Irish references)

---

## A/B Testing Caption Variations

### Test These Elements:

```
Version A: Question ("Ever waste hours on Pinterest?")
Version B: Statement ("This changed my workflow forever")
Version C: Emotion ("I'M SHAKING RN")
```

**CTA Placement:**
```
Version A: End of caption
Version B: Middle of caption
Version C: First line + end
```

**Length:**
```
Version A: Short (50-100 words)
Version B: Medium (100-200 words)
Version C: Long (200-300 words)
```

**Emoji Density:**
```
Version A: Heavy (every line)
Version B: Moderate (every 2-3 lines)
Version C: Light (strategic only)
```

### Track These Metrics:
- Engagement rate (likes + comments + saves / reach)
- Save rate (indicates value)
- Share rate (indicates virality)
- Profile visit rate (indicates interest)
- Link click rate (indicates conversion intent)
