- **Age:** 24
- **Role:** Fashion & Portrait Photographer
- **Location:** Dublin, Ireland
- **Background:** Recently graduated from photography school, building portfolio, does 60% paid shoots / 40% TFP collaborations
- **Tech Savvy:** High - Early adopter, active on Instagram (12K followers), uses Lightroom/Photoshop daily
- **Pain Point:** Struggles to visualize concepts before shoots, wastes time on Pinterest
- **Preset Usage:** Uses AI Playground 3-4x/week to generate moodboards and concept visuals for client pitches
- **Income:** €1,200-2,500/month from photography (variable)

**Scene Description:**
Sarah sits in her small rented bedroom converted into a creative workspace. The room reflects a young photographer's reality: IKEA furniture mixed with thrifted finds, a corner dedicated to her camera gear, prints she's shot taped to walls, fairy lights for ambiance on a budget. Her MacBook Pro (slightly worn, stickers on it) is propped on a stack of photography books. She's mid-conversation, still in her casual home clothes - oversized vintage band tee and mom jeans. Half-drunk iced coffee sits nearby. The afternoon golden hour light streams through sheer curtains.

**What She's Actually Doing:**
- Scrolling through her AI-generated images showing fashion editorial concepts
- Browser tabs open: Preset AI Playground (active), Pinterest (for comparison), Instagram for reference
- Has already saved 15+ generated images to a moodboard titled "Summer Editorial 2025"
- Checking her phone notifications - 3 new gig applications came in while creating
- Desktop background: One of her own photoshoots from last month

**Prompt:**
```
Medium shot of an authentic female photographer, 24 years old, East Asian descent, natural loose hair in messy bun, wearing oversized vintage Nirvana band t-shirt and high-waisted mom jeans, sitting cross-legged on her bed-turned-workspace in a small rented bedroom. She's holding her slightly worn MacBook Pro (visible stickers: camera brands, travel stickers), excitedly showing the screen to camera with genuine enthusiasm. Behind her: string fairy lights across cream walls, her own portrait prints taped up with washi tape, Sony A7III camera on floating shelf with 3 lenses, thrifted ornate gold-frame vintage mirror, small potted succulents on windowsill, stack of photography books as laptop stand. Natural afternoon golden hour sunlight streams through sheer white curtains creating soft shadows and warm glow. Half-drunk iced coffee with condensation on IKEA bedside table, iPhone 14 Pro charging nearby. She's gesturing naturally with one hand, laughing slightly, looking between her screen and camera with excited eyes. Room temperature: cozy, lived-in, authentic creator space. Camera: iPhone 14 Pro vertical video, slight handheld shake (as if friend filming), natural warm color grading, golden hour lighting, authentic creator-in-her-element aesthetic with film grain.
```

**Suggested Voiceover/Caption:**
"Okay so I just discovered the AI Playground on Preset and I'm OBSESSED! I literally generated this entire moodboard for my client pitch in like 10 minutes - something that usually takes me HOURS scrolling Pinterest. The image quality is actually insane?? And I can use these directly in my shoot deck! Game changer for pre-production, not even joking."

- **Tech Savvy:** Medium - Professional tools user, not on social media much
- **Pain Point:** Expensive gear sitting unused, rental houses take huge commission
- **Preset Usage:** Lists equipment for rent/share, made €1,200 extra last month
- **Income:** €4,500-7,000/month (cinematography + equipment rental)
- **Gear Worth:** €45,000+ (RED, cinema lenses, lighting)

**Scene Description:**
Emma's apartment living room has been converted into a gear staging area - professional cinematographer's home base. She's sitting on the floor surrounded by organized pelican cases, RED Komodo 6K camera, cinema prime lenses, lighting kits. The space has industrial-modern aesthetic - concrete walls, large windows with natural light, professional equipment everywhere but organized. This isn't a bedroom setup - this is a professional's workspace. She's in casual work clothes - comfortable but professional.

**What She's Actually Doing:**
- Showing Preset equipment rental/share listing on her phone
- Just rented her RED Komodo to another cinematographer for weekend shoot
- Made €600 for 2 days (her camera would have sat unused)
- Phone shows: Preset equipment listing with her gear, 5-star ratings, insurance verified
- Renter's profile visible - also a professional with good reviews (peer-to-peer trust)
- Email from rental: "Equipment picked up, deposit confirmed"
- Behind her: Pelican cases labeled, lenses organized, C-stands, lighting equipment
- This is side income supporting her film career

**Prompt:**

Medium close-up of a professional female cinematographer, 32 years old, Irish, natural makeup with minimal jewelry, wearing casual black work shirt and jeans, sitting on polished concrete floor of her apartment surrounded by professional camera equipment. She's holding iPhone 13 Pro showing Preset equipment rental listing page with her RED Komodo 6K camera and cinema lenses listed, explaining to camera with helpful, informative tone. Behind her: organized black Pelican cases (labeled with gear tape), RED Komodo 6K on Tilta cage, set of Rokinon Xeen cinema prime lenses in case, Aputure 600D light, C-stands, apple boxes stacked. The space has industrial-modern aesthetic with exposed concrete walls, large window providing natural soft light, minimal furniture, professional cinematographer's home workspace. Small potted succulent on windowsill, MacBook Pro on nearby coffee table with DaVinci Resolve interface visible. She has a professional, approachable demeanor - educator energy. Warm practical lighting from floor lamps mixing with natural window light. Professional workspace that shows she's a working cinematographer. Camera: Grounded vertical video from iPhone on low tripod, warm tungsten-balanced lighting, professional UGC documentary style, natural color grade, authentic cinematographer lifestyle aesthetic.
```

**Suggested Voiceover/Caption:**
"So I just rented out my RED Komodo for a weekend shoot through Preset's equipment sharing feature - made €600 for gear that would have just sat here unused. The cinematographer who rented it is from right here in Cork, has great reviews on the platform, and Preset verified the insurance. Way cheaper than rental houses and I'm supporting another local filmmaker. This is honestly brilliant - my €45K worth of gear is finally making passive income when I'm not using it. If you own cinema gear, you need to be on this platform!"
