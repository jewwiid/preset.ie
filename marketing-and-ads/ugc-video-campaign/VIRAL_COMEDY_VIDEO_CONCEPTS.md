# Viral Comedy UGC Video Concepts - Preset Platform

> **Fun, shareable, meme-worthy short videos that entertain first, promote second. Think TikTok comedy meets creative struggles.**

---

## Philosophy: Make Them Laugh, Then Make Them Click

These aren't traditional ads. They're genuinely funny scenarios that creatives will relate to, share with friends, and remember. The Preset mention is subtle - the comedy is the hero.

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Relatability over perfection
- ✅ Pop culture references Gen-Z/Millennials know
- ✅ Self-deprecating humor (creatives love this)
- ✅ Shock value & surprise endings
- ✅ Highly shareable format
- ✅ Preset is solution, not the punchline

## Video 1: "POV: You're a Creative Checking Your Bank Account"

### Concept
Horror movie parody - creative slowly opens banking app, dramatic music builds, reveals €43.67 balance, then cuts to them frantically opening Preset and applying to 5 gigs in panic mode.

### Setup
**Genre:** Horror comedy parody (Hereditary/Midsommar vibes)
**Length:** 15 seconds
**Platform:** TikTok (perfect for horror parody trend)

### Sora Prompt
```
POV shot of hands holding iPhone in dark moody room, dramatic horror movie lighting with single desk lamp creating harsh shadows. Hands slowly, nervously open banking app - fingers trembling. Cut to extreme close-up of face (male, 26, creative type, messy hair, tired eyes) with look of absolute dread as screen light reflects on face showing €43.67. Horror movie zoom on face. Quick cut to same person now frantically speed-scrolling through Preset app with manic energy, tapping "Apply" repeatedly with desperate determination. Room has film posters, camera equipment barely visible in shadows. Camera: Cinematic horror style, then switches to chaotic handheld panic. Lighting shifts from moody horror blue to warm hopeful orange as Preset opens. 15 seconds total.
```

### Suggested Audio
- First 8 seconds: Creepy violin/horror ambience (trending TikTok horror sound)
- Last 7 seconds: Upbeat energetic music (relief/solution)

**Length:** 20 seconds
**Platform:** Instagram Reels / TikTok

### Four Types

**Panel 1: The Cool Guy** (trying to play it cool)

- Types: "Yeah, I could probably do that" (but internally SCREAMING)

**Panel 2: The Overthinker**
- Sees notification
- Immediately opens 17 tabs researching client
- Checks their Instagram, LinkedIn, reviews
- Rehearses response for 30 minutes
- Still hasn't replied

**Panel 3: The Chaos Gremlin**
- Sees notification at 3am

- Checks details 5 minutes before shoot

**Panel 4: The Professional** (but make it unhinged)

- Internally does full touchdown celebration

### Sora Prompt
```
Split screen 4-panel video showing 4 different people (diverse ages, genders, styles) all receiving the same phone notification "You've been invited to a gig on Preset!":

Panel 1 (Top Left): Cool hipster guy, 27, beanie, trying to look uninterested but failing. Minimal reaction, small smirk, types slowly. Room: trendy minimal aesthetic.

Panel 2 (Top Right): Anxious creative woman, 25, glasses, hair in messy bun, immediately opens laptop alongside phone, 5+ browser tabs visible, spiraling into research mode. Room: organized chaos, sticky notes everywhere.

Panel 3 (Bottom Left): Chaotic energy person, 23, colorful hair, still in pajamas at weird hour, IMMEDIATE accept without reading, phone at 3% battery. Room: absolute creative mess, LED lights, energy drink cans.

Panel 4 (Bottom Right): Professional woman, 30, business casual, opens planner and rate calculator, crafts response methodically while doing silent fist pumps. Room: clean home office, vision board visible.

All panels show phone screens with Preset notification clearly. Reactions are exaggerated, comedic timing. Camera: Static 4-way split screen, each panel is iPhone vertical perspective. 20 seconds, synchronized timing.

Side-by-side split screen video:

LEFT SIDE - "Expectation" (Instagram aesthetic):
Glamorous photographer, perfect makeup, flowing dress, golden hour light, effortlessly posing with vintage film camera, laughing with gorgeous model in magazine-worthy scene, perfect coffee in hand, aesthetic studio. Everything is curated perfection. Slow-motion, dreamy filter, professional cinema camera quality.

RIGHT SIDE - "Reality" (actual day):
Same photographer, now in stained hoodie and leggings, hair in chaotic bun, running around frantically with dead camera battery, climbing on chairs for angles, half-eaten granola bar in mouth, model is her friend who's on phone checking time, makeshift backdrop is bedsheet taped to wall, laptop showing Preset app with "just booked 3 more of these" message, coffee is cold gas station cup. Authentic chaos but she's HAPPY because she's booked. Handheld iPhone footage, natural lighting, real moment.

Both sides synchronized to show same moments - the myth vs truth. 20 seconds. Reality side shows Preset booking confirmation as the reason she's doing this chaos.

- Everything is hilariously robotic and failing
Aesthetic: Deliberately cheap DIY robot costume, sterile white room

RIGHT SIDE - "Actual Creative with AI Tools":
Real photographer, relaxed, using Preset's AI Playground on laptop to generate gorgeous moodboards, showing client on video call who's impressed, then going out and shooting beautiful photos with human touch, checking Preset app for next booking. Confident, successful, HUMAN.

## Production Notes for Viral Comedy Videos

### Keys to Viral Success:

**1. Hook in First 0.5 Seconds:**
- Shocking visual or text
- Relatable scenario setup
- Pop culture reference
- Physical comedy action

**2. Fast Pacing:**
- Jump cuts every 1-2 seconds
- Quick scene changes
- Text overlays for emphasis
- No dead air

**3. Trending Audio:**
- Use TikTok trending sounds when possible
- Comedy music from trending library
- Recognizable pop culture audio
- Or go viral with original sound

**4. Shareability Factor:**
"Tag a creative who..." is your best friend:
- Tag a creative who needs to see this
- Which one are you? (Quiz format)
- Send this to your photographer friend
- This is too real

**5. Comment Bait:**
End with question or debate:
- Which stage are you at?
- How do YOU explain your job?
- Team chaos or team organized?

### Platform-Specific Optimization:

**TikTok:**
- 15-25 seconds max
- Trending sounds MANDATORY
- Text overlays for no-sound viewers
- Fast, chaotic energy
- Gen-Z humor (self-deprecating, absurd)

**Instagram Reels:**
- 20-30 seconds optimal
- Can use original audio
- More polished than TikTok (slightly)
- Millennial humor (nostalgic, sarcastic)
- Caption is KEY (Instagram favors strong captions)

**YouTube Shorts:**
- Up to 60 seconds (use it!)
- Can be more story-driven
- Thumbnail matters (even for Shorts)
- CTAs to longer content work well

### Preset Branding Strategy:

**Subtle > Heavy-Handed:**
- ✅ Preset appears as natural solution
- ✅ App visible on screen in scene
- ✅ Mentioned casually in voiceover
- ❌ "Download Preset today!"
- ❌ Feature list recitation
- ❌ Salesy language

**Goal: Make Them Curious**
If they laugh and think "wait what app is that?" → You win
If they laugh and share without clicking → You STILL win (brand awareness)

### Comment Engagement Strategy:

**Pin This First Comment:**
"Which creative struggle hits different for you? 👇 (Also yes this is a Preset ad but hopefully a funny one 😅)"

**Respond to Comments Like:**
- "Tag yourself I'm #3" → "We all are 💀"
- "This is too real" → "Therapy is expensive, this video is free"
- "What app is that?" → "Preset! Link in bio. Changed my life fr"
