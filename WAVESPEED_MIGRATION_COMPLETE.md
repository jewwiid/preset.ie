# ✅ Wavespeed Pay-Per-Use Migration - Complete

## 🎯 What Changed

Migrated from **pre-purchased credit pools** (NanoBanana) to **pay-per-use billing** (Wavespeed).

### Before (NanoBanana Model):
```
❌ Platform pre-buys 100k credits → Users can only buy if credits available
❌ "Studio Pack temporarily unavailable" if platform low on credits
❌ Platform manages credit inventory
```

### After (Wavespeed Model):
```
✅ Platform pays per actual use → No pre-purchase needed
✅ All credit packages ALWAYS available
✅ No inventory management
```

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Credit Package Availability** 
**File:** `apps/web/app/api/credits/purchase/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Checked platform capacity before allowing purchase
const availableUserCredits = Math.floor(platformCredit.available_balance / creditRatio);
available: pkg.credits <= availableUserCredits  // ❌ Could be unavailable
```

**After:**
```typescript
// All packages always available with pay-per-use
available: true  // ✅ Always available
```

### 2. **Removed Capacity Checks**
**Removed:**
- Platform capacity validation
- NanoBanana credit ratio calculations (1:4)
- "Temporarily unavailable" messages
- Low credit warnings

**Added:**
```typescript
platformCapacity: {
  model: 'wavespeed_pay_per_use',
  allPackagesAvailable: true,
  note: 'All credit packages always available (pay-per-use billing)'
}
```

### 3. **Removed Credit Pool Updates**
**Before:**
```typescript
// Reserved credits from platform pool
await supabase
  .from('credit_pools')
  .update({
    available_balance: platformCredit.available_balance - requiredCredits,
    total_consumed: platformCredit.total_consumed + requiredCredits
  })
```

**After:**
```typescript
// No need to update credit_pools with pay-per-use
// Credits charged from Wavespeed when actually consumed
```

## 💰 Credit Purchase Flow (Updated)

### **User Buys Credits:**
1. User selects "Studio Pack" (500 credits, $299.99)
2. ✅ Package is ALWAYS available (no capacity check)
3. Payment processed via Stripe
4. Webhook adds credits to `user_credits.purchased_credits_balance`
5. Credits ready to use immediately

### **User Uses Credits:**
1. User generates image enhancement
2. Credits deducted from `user_credits.current_balance`
3. Backend calls Wavespeed API
4. Wavespeed bills you per actual API call
5. No pre-allocated credits needed

## 🎁 Lootbox System (Already Correct)

Lootbox availability is **time-based**, not capacity-based:
- ✅ Weekend Flash Sale: Friday 6pm - Sunday 11pm
- ✅ Mid-Month Mega Deal: 15th-17th of each month
- ✅ Not affected by platform capacity

---

## 📊 What This Means

### **For Users:**
✅ All credit packages always available
✅ No "temporarily unavailable" messages
✅ Better user experience
✅ Purchased credits roll over forever

### **For Platform:**
✅ No inventory management
✅ No pre-purchasing credits
✅ Pay only for what users actually consume
✅ Simpler financial model
✅ Better cash flow (collect upfront, pay on usage)

---

## 🔄 Credit Types Summary

| Type | Roll Over? | Always Available? | Billing Model |
|------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Subscription Credits** | ❌ Monthly reset | ✅ Yes | Fixed monthly fee |
| **Purchased Credits** | ✅ Forever | ✅ Yes | One-time payment |
| **Lootbox Credits** | ✅ Forever | ⏰ Time-based | Flash sale pricing |

### **How Credits Are Billed:**
```
User buys 500 credits → You collect $299.99 upfront
User uses 100 credits → Wavespeed bills you ~$8
You keep: $291.99 (until more credits are used)
```

**Profit Margin:**
- Your cost: ~$0.08/credit (Wavespeed)
- Your price: $0.60/credit (Studio Pack)
- Margin: 650% 🎉

## 🧪 Testing

### **Before Fix:**
```
Studio Pack: 500 credits
Status: "Temporarily Unavailable" ❌
Reason: Platform credit pool too low
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Studio Pack: 500 credits
Status: Available ✅
Button: "Purchase" (enabled)
```

### **Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/credits/purchase`
2. All packages should show as available
3. No "Temporarily Unavailable" messages
4. Complete a purchase
5. Credits should be added immediately

## 📈 Business Model

### **Old Model (Pre-Purchase):**
```
Month 1: Buy 100k NanoBanana credits for $800
Month 1: Users consume 60k credits
Month 1: Wasted: $320 (40k unused credits may expire)
```

### **New Model (Pay-Per-Use):**
```
Month 1: Users buy credits upfront → You collect $5,000
Month 1: Users consume 60k credits → You pay ~$480 to Wavespeed
Month 1: Profit: $4,520 (90%+ margin!)
Month 1: No waste, pay only for actual usage
```

**Benefits:**
- 💰 Better margins
- 📊 Predictable costs
- 🎯 No inventory risk
- ✅ Always available to users

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### **Optional Cleanup:**
You can now remove/deprecate:
- `credit_pools` table (not used anymore)
- Platform capacity dashboard
- Low credit alerts
- Manual credit refill system

### **Keep:**
- `user_credits` table (tracks user balances)
- `user_credit_purchases` table (transaction history)
- Credit consumption tracking
- Monthly reset logic (for subscription credits)

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem:** Studio Pack showing "Temporarily Unavailable" due to legacy NanoBanana capacity checks

**Root Cause:** Code was checking pre-purchased credit pools that don't exist in Wavespeed model

**Solution:** Removed all capacity checks, set all packages to always available

**Result:** 
- ✅ All credit packages now available 24/7
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Simpler codebase
- ✅ Pay-per-use billing matches business model

**Status:** 🎉 **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**
