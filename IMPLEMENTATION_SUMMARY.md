## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **1. Development Server**:
```bash
cd /Users/judeokun/Documents/GitHub/preset/preset.ie/preset
npm run dev
# or
bash restart-dev-server.sh
```

### **2. Navigate to Dashboard**:
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

### **3. Test Different User Types**:

**Test Case 1: Sarah Chen (CONTRIBUTOR, 92% complete)**
- Expected: Profile completion, perfect matches, equipment suggestions
- URL: Sign in as Sarah, go to `/dashboard`

**Test Case 2: Zara Ahmed (TALENT, 88% complete)**
- Expected: Profile completion, match improvements (height, portfolio)
- URL: Sign in as Zara, go to `/dashboard`

**Test Case 3: New User (< 50% complete)**
- Expected: Complete profile prompt, high-impact fields
- Create new account, go to `/dashboard`

### **4. Verify Each Suggestion**:
- [ ] Profile completion shows correct percentage
- [ ] Top matches load from database
- [ ] Match improvements are role-specific
- [ ] Deadline alerts show urgent gigs
- [ ] Nearby gigs show other cities
- [ ] All buttons navigate correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Loading state works

## 🐛 **Bug Fixes Applied**

### **Build Error**: Module not found: '@/lib/supabase/client'
**Solution**: 
- Changed import to `import { supabase } from '../../supabase'`
- Updated all function signatures to use `typeof supabase`
- Changed all `await supabase.` to `await (supabaseClient as any).`
- Added null checks for client initialization

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - No linter errors

## 🎓 **Key Technical Decisions**

### **1. Separate Utility File**
- Reusable functions for profile analysis
- Consistent with existing `ProfileCompletionCard`
- Easy to test and maintain

### **2. Custom Hook Pattern**
- `useSmartSuggestions` hook for data fetching
- Follows React best practices
- Separates concerns (data vs presentation)

### **3. Priority-Based Display**
- Urgent suggestions (deadlines) shown first
- Profile completion always visible when < 100%
- Legacy suggestions shown last

### **4. Role Awareness**
- Filters suggestions by user role
- Different insights for TALENT vs CONTRIBUTOR
- Prevents irrelevant recommendations

### **5. Database Integration**
- Uses existing RPC functions where possible
- Efficient queries with proper filtering
- Real-time gig counting
