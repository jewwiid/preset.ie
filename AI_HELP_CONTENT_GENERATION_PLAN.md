# Ready Preset Go - AI-Powered Help Content Generation Plan

## 🎯 **Project Vision**
Create authentic, real-world help articles by having AI actually use the Preset platform as a real user would, documenting every step and interaction. This creates a knowledge base that an AI chatbot can later use to provide accurate, experience-based answers.

## 📋 **Project Overview**

### **Core Concept**
Instead of writing help articles based on assumptions, we'll have AI agents:
1. **Act as real users** (Contributors, Talent, Admins)
2. **Complete actual workflows** on the platform
3. **Document every interaction** step-by-step
4. **Generate authentic help content** based on real experience
5. **Build AI chatbot knowledge base** from documented workflows

### **Key Benefits**
- ✅ **100% Accurate Content** - Based on actual platform usage
- ✅ **Real-World Context** - Addresses actual user pain points
- ✅ **AI-Ready Knowledge** - Perfect foundation for intelligent chatbot
- ✅ **Continuous Updates** - AI can refresh content as platform evolves
- ✅ **User-Centric** - Content that actually helps users succeed

const gigCreationWorkflow = {
  steps: [
    "Navigate to /gigs/create",
    "Fill gig title field",
    "Select category from dropdown",
    "Set budget range",
    "Add location details",
    "Upload moodboard images",
    "Set requirements",
    "Publish gig",

  ],
  documentation: {
    screenshots: [],
    formFields: {},
    validationRules: {},
    errorStates: {},
    successCriteria: {}
  }
}
```

### **AI Content Generation Pipeline**
```python
# Pseudo-code for content generation
def generate_help_article(feature_name, user_journey_data):
    article = {
        "title": f"How to {feature_name}",
        "introduction": generate_intro(user_journey_data),
        "prerequisites": extract_prerequisites(user_journey_data),
        "step_by_step": generate_steps(user_journey_data),
        "troubleshooting": extract_common_issues(user_journey_data),
        "tips_and_tricks": generate_tips(user_journey_data),

    def __init__(self):
        self.test_results = []
    
    def validate_workflow(self, workflow_data):
        """Validate that documented workflow actually works"""
        validation_results = {
            "steps_completed": 0,
            "errors_encountered": [],
            "success_rate": 0.0,
            "performance_metrics": {}
        }
        
        for step in workflow_data.steps:
            result = self.execute_step(step)
            validation_results.update(self.analyze_step_result(result))
        
        return validation_results
    
    def generate_validation_report(self):
        """Generate comprehensive validation report"""
